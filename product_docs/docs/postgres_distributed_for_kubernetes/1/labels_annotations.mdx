: Indicates the type of the certificates. `replication` indicates a certificate
to be used to authenticate the replication client, `server` indicates a
certificate to be used for server authentication.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/group`
: Name of the pgdgroup that the resource belongs to. Added to cluster or
instance resources

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/isWitnessService`
: Indicates a service is for a witness node

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/type`
: Type of the resource, added to cluster or instance resources, usually `node`

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/workloadType`
: Indicates the workload type of the resource, added to cluster or instance
resources. `pgd-node-data` indicates data node; `pgd-node-witness` a witness
node; `pgd-proxy` for pgd proxy node;
`proxy-svc` for pgd proxy service; `group-svc` for pgd group service to
communicate with any node in the PGDGroup;
`node-svc`  is a service created from the cnp service template;
`scheduled-backup` is added to scheduledBackup
resources; `bootstrap-cross-location-pgd-group` is added to the pod that
creates a cross-location PGD group;
`pgd-node-restore` is added to the pod that starts the node restore process.

## Predefined annotations

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/dirtyMetadata`
: Set in CNP cluster that have been generated from a backup and need to have
their metadata cleaned up
before creating the PGD node. This is written by the restore job.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/hash`
: Contains the hash of the used PGDGroup spec

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/latestCleanupExecuted`
: Set in the PGDGroup to indicate that the cleanup has been executed.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/node`
: Contains the name of the node for which a certain certificate has been
generated. Added to the certificate resources.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/noFinalizers`
: Set in the PGDGroup with value `true` to skip the finalizer execution. This
is for internal use only.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/pause`
: Set in the PGDGroup to pause a PGDGroup.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/recoverabilityPointsByMethod`
: Set in the PGDGroup to store the CNP clusters' First Recoverability points by
method in a tamper-proof place.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/seedingServer`
: Set in the PGDGroup to indicate to the operator which is the server to be
restored. This is written by the restore job.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/seedingSnapshots`
: Set in the PGDGroup to indicate to the operator which are the snapshots to be
