This section contains information about security for EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes,
that are analyzed at 3 different layers: Code, Container and Cluster.

!!! Warning
    The information contained in this page must not exonerate you from
    performing regular InfoSec duties on your Kubernetes cluster. Please
    familiarize yourself with the ["Overview of Cloud Native Security"](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/overview/)
    page from the Kubernetes documentation.

!!! Seealso "About the 4C's Security Model"
    Please refer to ["The 4C's Security Model in Kubernetes"](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/4cs-security-model-kubernetes)
    blog article to get a better understanding and context of the approach EDB
    has taken with security in EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes.

## Code

Source code of EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes is *systematically scanned* for static analysis purposes,
including **security problems**, using a popular open-source linter for Go called
[GolangCI-Lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) directly in the CI/CD pipeline.
GolangCI-Lint can run several *linters* on the same source code.

One of these is [Golang Security Checker](https://github.com/securego/gosec), or simply `gosec`,
a linter that scans the abstract syntactic tree of the source against a set of rules aimed at
the discovery of well-known vulnerabilities, threats, and weaknesses hidden in
the code such as hard-coded credentials, integer overflows and SQL injections - to name a few.

!!! Important
    A failure in the static code analysis phase of the CI/CD pipeline is a blocker
    for the entire delivery of EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes, meaning that each commit is validated
    against all the linters defined by GolangCI-Lint.

## Container

Every container image that is part of EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes is automatically built via CI/CD pipelines following every commit.
Such images include not only the operator's, but also the operands' - specifically every supported PostgreSQL version.
Within the pipelines, images are scanned with:

-   [Dockle](https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle): for best practices in terms
    of the container build process
-   [Clair](https://github.com/quay/clair): for vulnerabilities found in both the
    underlying operating system and libraries and applications that they run

!!! Important
    All operand images are automatically rebuilt once a day by our pipelines in case
    of security updates at the base image and package level, providing **patch level updates**
    for the container images that EDB distributes.

The following guidelines and frameworks have been taken into account for container-level security:

-   the ["Container Image Creation and Deployment Guide"](https://dl.dod.cyber.mil/wp-content/uploads/devsecops/pdf/DevSecOps_Enterprise_Container_Image_Creation_and_Deployment_Guide_2.6-Public-Release.pdf),
    developed by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD)
-   the ["CIS Benchmark for Docker"](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/docker/),
    developed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS)

!!! Seealso "About the Container level security"
    Please refer to ["Security and Containers in EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes"](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/security-and-containers-cloud-native-postgresql)
    blog article for more information about the approach that EDB has taken on
    security at the container level in EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes.

## Cluster

Security at the cluster level takes into account all Kubernetes components that
form both the control plane and the nodes, as well as the applications that run in
the cluster (PostgreSQL included).

### Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

The operator interacts with the Kubernetes API server with a dedicated service
account called `pgd-operator-controller-manager`. In Kubernetes this is installed
by default in the `pgd-operator-system` namespace, with a cluster role
binding between this service account and the `pgd-operator-controller-manager`
cluster role which defines the set of rules/resources/verbs granted to the operator.

RedHat OpenShift directly manage the operator RBAC entities via [Operator
Lifecycle
Manager](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-olm.html),
allowing the user to grant permissions only where they are required,
implementing the principle of least privilege.

!!! Important
    The above permissions are exclusively reserved for the operator's service
    account to interact with the Kubernetes API server.  They are not directly
    accessible by the users of the operator that interact only with `PGDGroup`
    and `PGDGroupCleanup` resources.

Below we provide some examples and, most importantly, the reasons why
EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes requires full or partial management of standard Kubernetes
namespaced resources.

`jobs`
: The operator needs to handle jobs to manage different `PGDGroup`'s phases.

`poddisruptionbudgets`
: The operator uses pod disruption budgets to make sure enough PGD Nodes
  are kept active during maintenance operations.

`pods`
: The operator needs to manage PGD Nodes (as a `Cluster` resource).

`secrets`
: Unless you provide certificates and passwords to your data nodes,
  the operator adopts the "convention over configuration" paradigm by
  self-provisioning random generated passwords and TLS certificates, and by
  storing them in secrets.

`serviceaccounts`
: The operator needs to create a service account to
  enable the PGDGroup recovery job to retrieve the backup objects from
  the object store where they reside.

`services`
: The operator needs to control network access to the PGD cluster
  from applications, and properly manage
  failover/switchover operations in an automated way.

`statefulsets`
: The operator needs to manage PGD Proxies.

`validatingwebhookconfigurations` and `mutatingwebhookconfigurations`
: The operator injects its self-signed webhook CA into both webhook
  configurations, which are needed to validate and mutate all the resources it
  manages. For more details, please see the
  [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/).

To see all the permissions required by the operator, you can run `kubectl
describe clusterrole pgd-operator-manager-role`.

PG4K-PGD internally manages the PGD nodes using the `Cluster` resource as defined by EDB Postgres
for Kubernetes (PG4K). We refer you to the
[EDB Postgres for Kubernetes documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/security/)
for the list of permissions used by PG4K operator service account.

### Calls to the API server made by the instance manager

The instance manager, which is the entry point of the operand container, needs
to make some calls to the Kubernetes API server to ensure that the status of
some resources is correctly updated and to access the config maps and secrets
that are associated with that Postgres cluster. Such calls are performed through
a dedicated `ServiceAccount` created by the operator that shares the same
PostgreSQL `Cluster` resource name.

!!! Important
    The operand can only access a specific and limited subset of resources
    through the API server. A service account is the
    [recommended way to access the API server from within a Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/access-api-from-pod/).

We refer you to the
[EDB Postgres for Kubernetes documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/security/)
for additional depth on the instance manager.

### Pod Security Policies

A [Pod Security Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/)
is the Kubernetes way to define security rules and specifications that a pod needs to meet
to run in a cluster.
For InfoSec reasons, every Kubernetes platform should implement them.

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes does not require *privileged* mode for containers execution.
The PostgreSQL containers run as `postgres` system user. No component whatsoever requires running as `root`.

Likewise, Volumes access does not require *privileges* mode or `root` privileges either.
Proper permissions must be properly assigned by the Kubernetes platform and/or administrators.
The PostgreSQL containers run with a read-only root filesystem (i.e. no writable layer).

The operator explicitly sets the required security contexts.

On Red Hat OpenShift, Cloud Native PostgreSQL runs in `restricted` security context constraint,
the most restrictive one. The goal is to limit the execution of a pod to a namespace allocated UID
and SELinux context.

!!! Seealso "Security Context Constraints in OpenShift"
    For further information on Security Context Constraints (SCC) in
    OpenShift, please refer to the
    ["Managing SCC in OpenShift"](https://www.openshift.com/blog/managing-sccs-in-openshift)
    article.

!!! Warning "Security Context Constraints and namespaces"
    As stated by [Openshift documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html#role-based-access-to-ssc_configuring-internal-oauth)
    SCCs are not applied in the default namespaces (`default`, `kube-system`,
    `kube-public`, `openshift-node`, `openshift-infra`, `openshift`) and those
    should not be used to run pods. CNP clusters deployed in those namespaces
    will be unable to start due to missing SCCs.



#### Exposed Ports

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes exposes ports at operator, instance manager and operand
levels, as listed in the table below:

| System           | Port number | Exposing            | Name             | Certificates | Authentication |
| :--------------- | :---------- | :------------------ | :--------------- | :----------- | :------------- |
| operator         | 9443        | webhook server      | `webhook-server` | TLS          | Yes            |
| operator         | 8080        | metrics             | `metrics`        | no TLS       | No             |
| instance manager | 9187        | metrics             | `metrics`        | no TLS       | No             |
| instance manager | 8000        | status              | `status`         | no TLS       | No             |
| operand          | 5432        | PostgreSQL instance | `postgresql`     | optional TLS | Yes            |

### PGD

The current implementation of EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes automatically creates
passwords for the `postgres` superuser and the database owner.

As far as encryption of password is concerned, EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes follows
the default behavior of PostgreSQL: starting from PostgreSQL 14,
`password_encryption` is by default set to `scram-sha-256`, while on earlier
versions it is set to `md5`.

!!! Important
    Please refer to the ["Connection DSNs and SSL"](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/nodes/#connection-dsns-and-ssl-tls)
    section in the PGD documentation for details.

You can disable management of the `postgres` user password via secrets by setting
`enableSuperuserAccess` to `false` in the `cnp` section of the spec.

!!! Note
    The operator supports toggling the `enableSuperuserAccess` option. When you
    disable it on a running cluster, the operator will ignore the content of the secret,
    remove it (if previously generated by the operator) and set the password of the
    `postgres` user to `NULL` (de facto disabling remote access through password authentication).

### Storage

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes delegates encryption at rest to the underlying storage class. For
data protection in production environments, we highly recommend that you choose
a storage class that supports encryption at rest.
