The images for the EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes and EDB Postgres for
Kubernetes operators, as well as various operands, are kept in private
container image registries under `docker.enterprisedb.com`.

!!! Important
    Access to the private registries requires an account with EDB and is
    reserved to EDB customers with a valid [subscription plan](https://www.enterprisedb.com/products/plans-comparison#selfmanagedenterpriseplan).
    Credentials will be funneled through your EDB account.
    For trials, please refer to the ["Trials"](#trials) section below.

## Which repository to choose?

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes is available as part of the "Extreme
High Availability Add-On" on top of either the "EDB Enterprise Plan" or "EDB
Standard Plan".

Depending on your subscription plan, EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes
will be in one of the following repositories, as described in the table below:

| Plan                  | Repository           |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| EDB Standard Plan     | `k8s_standard_pgd`   |
| EDB EnterpriseDB Plan | `k8s_enterprise_pgd` |

The name of the repository shall be used as the *Username* when you try to
login to the EDB container registry, for example through `docker login` or a
[`kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` pull secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#secret-types).

!!! Important
    Each repository contains all the images you can access with your plan.
    You don't need to connect to different repositories to access different
    images, such as operator or operand images.

## How to retrieve the token

In the ["repos" page in EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads),
you'll find an *EDB Repos 2.0* section where a `Repo Token` is shown obscured.

![EDB Repo Portal](images/edb-repo-portal.png)

Next to the "Repo Token" you'll find a button to copy the token, and an eye icon
in case you want to look at the content of the token.

The "Repo Token" shall be used as the *Password* when you try to login to EDB
container registry.

### Example with `docker login`

You should be able to logon via Docker from your terminal. We suggest you
copy the Repo Token using the `Copy Token` button. The `docker` command below
will prompt you for a username and a password.

As explained above, the username should be the repo you are trying to access
while the password is the token you just copied.

```sh
$ docker login docker.enterprisedb.com  
Username: k8s_enterprise_pgd
Password: 
Login Succeeded
```

## Trials

If you are a trialist or a preview user, use `k8s_enterprise_pgd` as the name
of the repository and follow the instructions in
["How to retrieve the token"](#how-to-retrieve-the-token) for the token.

## Operand images

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes is an operator that supports running
Postgres Distributed (PGD) version 5 on three PostgreSQL distributions:

-   PostgreSQL
-   EDB Postgres Advanced
-   EDB Postgres Extended

!!! Important
    Please refer to ["Choosing a Postgres distribution"](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/choosing_server/)
    from the PGD documentation for details and a comparison of PGD on the
    different supported PostgreSQL distributions.

Due to the immutable application container adoption in EDB operators, the
operator expects that the container images include all the binaries required
to run the requested version of PGD on top of the required distribution and
version of Postgres.

These images follow the requirements and the conventions described in the
["Container image requirements"](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/container_images/)
page of the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes documentation, adding the `bdr5`
extension.

In the table below you can find the image name prefix for each Postgres distribution:

| Postgres distribution | Versions | Image name                  | Repositories                             |
| --------------------- | -------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| EDB Postgres Extended | 15, 14   | `edb-postgres-extended-pgd` | `k8s_standard_pgd`, `k8s_enterprise_pgd` |
| EDB Postgres Advanced | 15, 14   | `edb-postgres-advanced-pgd` | `k8s_enterprise_pgd`                     |
