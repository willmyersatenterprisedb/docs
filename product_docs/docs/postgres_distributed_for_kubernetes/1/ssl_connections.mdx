    Please refer to the ["Certificates"](certificates.md)
    page for more details on how EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes supports TLS certificates.

The EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes operator has been designed to work with TLS/SSL for both encryption in transit and
authentication, on server and client sides. PGD nodes are created as Cluster
resources using the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes (PG4K) operator, and this
includes the deployment of a Certification
Authority (CA) to create and sign TLS client certificates.

Please refer to the [EDB Postgres for Kubernetes documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/ssl_connections/)
for further information on issuers and certificates.
