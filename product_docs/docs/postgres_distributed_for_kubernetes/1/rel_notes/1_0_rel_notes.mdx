navTitle: "Version 1.0"
---

**Release date:** 15 February 2024

This is the first major stable release of EDB Postgres Distributed for
Kubernetes, a Kubernetes operator to deploy and manage
EDB Postgres Distributed clusters.

The operator implements the `PGDGroup` custom resource
in the API group `pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io`.
This resource can be used to create and manage EDB Postgres Distributed clusters
inside Kubernetes with capabilities including:

-   Deployment of EDB Postgres Distributed clusters with versions 5 and later
-   Additional self-healing capability on top of that of Postgres Distributed,
    such as recovery and restart of failed PGD nodes
-   Definition of the services to connect applications to the
    write leader of each PGD group
-   Implementation of Raft subgroups
-   Support for Local Persistent Volumes with PVC templates
-   Reuse of Persistent Volumes storage in Pods
-   TLS connections and client certificate authentication
-   Continuous backup to an S3 compatible object store
-   Pause and resume a PGD cluster, saving computational resources by temporarily
    removing database pods while keeping the database PVCs.
