This is a currently known issue in EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes. 

## Backup

-   To configure an EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes environment, you must apply a `Cluster` YAML object to each Kubernetes cluster, 
    which then creates all necessary services for the implementation of a distributed architecture. 
  
    If you have added a `spec.backup` section to this section with the goal of setting up a backup configuration, the backup will fail 
    unless you also set the `spec.backup.cron.schedule` value. 

    Error output:

    ```
    The PGDGroup "region-a" is invalid: spec.backup.cron.schedule: Invalid value: "": Empty spec string
    ``` 

    To work around this issue, add a `spec.backup.cron.schedule` section with a schedule that meets your requirements.
