title: 'Known issues'

These known issues and limitations are in the current release of EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes. 

## Upgrades 

This version of EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes does **not support** migrating from existing Postgres databases, nor upgrading 
any of its components to more recent image versions.

## Backup

To configure an EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes environment, you must apply a `Cluster` YAML object to each Kubernetes cluster, 
which then creates all necessary services for the implementation of a distributed architecture. 
  
If you have added a `spec.backup` section to this `Cluster` object with the goal of setting up a backup configuration, the backup will fail 
unless you also set the `spec.backup.cron.schedule` value. 

Error output example:

```
The PGDGroup "region-a" is invalid: spec.backup.cron.schedule: Invalid value: "": Empty spec string
``` 

!!! Note Workaround 
    To work around this issue, add a `spec.backup.cron.schedule` section with a schedule that meets your requirements. 

## Connectivity with PgBouncer

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes does not support using PgBouncer to manage and pool client connection requests. This applies to 
both the open-source and EDB versions of PgBouncer.

## Known issues in EDB Postgres Distributed 

All issues known for the EDB Postgres Distributed version that you include in your deployment also affect your EDB Postgres Distributed 
for Kubernetes instance.

For example, if the EDB Postgres Distributed version you are using is 5.x, your EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes instance will be affected by 
[these 5.x known issues](/pgd/latest/known_issues/).
