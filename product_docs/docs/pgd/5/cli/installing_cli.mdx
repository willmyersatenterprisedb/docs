You can install PGD CLI on any system that can connect to the PGD cluster. To use PGD CLI, you need a user with PGD superuser privileges or equivalent. The PGD user with superuser privileges is the [bdr_superuser role](../security). An example of an equivalent user is edb_admin on an EDB BigAnimal distributed high-availability cluster.

## Installing automatically with Trusted Postgres Architect (TPA)

By default, Trusted Postgres Architect installs and configures PGD CLI on each PGD node. If you want to install PGD CLI on any non-PGD instance in the cluster, attach the pgdcli role to that instance in Trusted Postgres Architect's configuration file before deploying. See [Trusted Postgres Architect](/tpa/latest/) for more information.

## Installing manually on Linux

PGD CLI is installable from the EDB repositories, which you can access with your EDB account. PGD users and BigAnimal users, including those on a free trial, have an EDB account and access to PGD CLI.

### Obtain your EDB subscription token

These repositories require a token to enable downloads from them. To obtain your token, log in to [EDB Repos 2.0](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads). If this is your first time visiting the EDB Repos 2.0 page, you must select **Request Access** to generate your token. Once a generated token is available, select the **Copy** icon to copy it to your clipboard, or select the eye icon to view it.

### Set the EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN environment variable
Once you have the token, execute the command shown for your operating system, substituting
your token for `<your-token>`. 

```
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

Then run the appropriate commands for your operating system:

### Install on Debian or Ubuntu

```bash
curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/postgres_distributed/setup.deb.sh" | sudo -E bash
```

If this returns an error like `curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 404`, check that you have entered the correct token.

When successful, you will see output like this:

```
Executing the  setup script for the 'enterprisedb/postgres_distributed' repository ...
...
```

You can now install the PGD CLI package using the command:

```
sudo apt-get install edb-pgd5-cli
```

### Install on RHEL, Rocky, AlmaLinux, or Oracle Linux

```bash
curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/postgres_distributed/setup.rpm.sh" | sudo -E bash
```

If this returns an error like `curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 404`, check that you have entered the correct token.

When successful, you will see output like this:

```
Executing the  setup script for the 'enterprisedb/postgres_distributed' repository ...
...
```

You can now install the PGD CLI package using the command:

```
sudo yum install edb-pgd5-cli
```
