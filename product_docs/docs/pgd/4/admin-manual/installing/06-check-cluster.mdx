## Checking the cluster


With the cluster up and running, it is worthwhile running some basic checks on how effectively it is replicating.

In the following example, we show one quick way to do this but you should ensure that any testing you perform is appropriate for your use case.

* **Preparation**
  * Ensure the cluster is ready  
    * Log into the database on host-one/node-one  
    * Run `select bdr.wait_slot_confirm_lsn(NULL, NULL);`  
    * When the query returns the cluster is ready  


* **Create data**
  The simplest way to test the cluster is replicating is to log into one node, create a table and populate it.
   * On node-one create a table
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE quicktest ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, value INT ); 
      ```
   * On node-one populate the table
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO quicktest (value) SELECT random()*10000 FROM generate_series(1,10000);
     ```
   * On node-one monitor performance
     ```sql
     select * from bdr.node_replication_rates;
     ```
   * On node-one get a sum of the value column (for checking)
     ```sql
     select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
     ```
* **Check data**
   * Log into node-two  
      Log into the database on host-two/node-two
    * On node-two get a sum of the value column (for checking)
      ```sql
      select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
      ```
   * Compare with the result from node-one
   * Log into node-three 
      Log into the database on host-three/node-three
    * On node-three get a sum of the value column (for checking)
      ```sql
      select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
      ```
   * Compare with the result from node-one and node-two

## Worked example

### Preparation

Log into host-one's Postgres server.
```
ssh admin@host-one
sudo -iu enterprisedb psql bdrdb
```

This is your connection to PGD's node-one.

#### Ensure the cluster is ready

To ensure that the cluster is ready to go, run: 

```
select bdr.wait_slot_confirm_lsn(NULL, NULL)
```

This query will block while the cluster is busy initializing and return when the cluster is ready.

In another window, log into host-two's Postgres server

```
ssh admin@host-two
sudo -iu enterprisedb psql bdrdb
```

### Create data

#### On node-one create a table

Run

```sql
CREATE TABLE quicktest ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, value INT ); 
```

#### On node-one populate the table

```
INSERT INTO quicktest (value) SELECT random()*10000 FROM generate_series(1,10000);
```

This will generate a table of 10000 rows of random values. 

#### On node-one monitor performance

As soon as possible, run:

```sql
select * from bdr.node_replication_rates;
```

And you should see statistics on how quickly that data has been replicated to the other two nodes.

```console
bdrdb=# select * from bdr.node_replication_rates;
 peer_node_id | target_name | sent_lsn  | replay_lsn | replay_lag | replay_lag_bytes | replay_lag_size | apply_rate | catchup_interv
al
--------------+-------------+-----------+------------+------------+------------------+-----------------+------------+---------------
---
   1954860017 | node-three  | 0/DDAA908 | 0/DDAA908  | 00:00:00   |                0 | 0 bytes         |      13682 | 00:00:00
   2299992455 | node-two    | 0/DDAA908 | 0/DDAA908  | 00:00:00   |                0 | 0 bytes         |      13763 | 00:00:00
(2 rows)
```

And it's already replicated. 

#### On node-one get a checksum

Run:

```sql
select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
```

to get some values from the generated data:

```sql
bdrdb=# select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
__OUTPUT__
 count  |    sum
--------+-----------
 100000 | 498884606
(1 row)
```

### Check data

#### Log into host-two's Postgres server.
```
ssh admin@host-two
sudo -iu enterprisedb psql bdrdb
```

This is your connection to PGD's node-two.

#### On node-two get a checksum

Run:

```sql
select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
```

to get node-two's values for the generated data:

```sql
bdrdb=# select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
__OUTPUT__
 count  |    sum
--------+-----------
 100000 | 498884606
(1 row)
```

#### Compare with the result from node-one

And the values will be identical.

You can repeat the process with node-three, or generate new data on any node and see it replicate to the other nodes.

#### Log into host-three's Postgres server.
```
ssh admin@host-two
sudo -iu enterprisedb psql bdrdb
```

This is your connection to PGD's node-three.

#### On node-three get a checksum

Run:

```sql
select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
```

to get node-three's values for the generated data:

```sql
bdrdb=# select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
__OUTPUT__
 count  |    sum
--------+-----------
 100000 | 498884606
(1 row)
```

#### Compare with the result from node-one and node-two

And the values will be identical.
