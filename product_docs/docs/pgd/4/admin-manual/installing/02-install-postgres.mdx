## Installing Postgres

You will need to install Postgres on all the hosts.

An EDB account is required to use the [EDB Repos 2.0](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos) page where you can get installation instructions.
Select your platform and Postgres edition. 
You will be presented with 2 steps of instructions, the first covering how to configure the required package repository and the second covering how to install the packages from that repository.

Run both steps.

## Worked example

In our example, we will be installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL 9).

!!! Note
PGD 4 does not support Postgres versions 15, 16, or later
!!!

### EDB account

You'll need an EDB account to install both Postgres and PGD.

Use your EDB account to sign in to the [EDB Repos 2.0](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos) page where you can select your platform and then scroll down the list to select the Postgres version you wish to install:

* EDB Postgres Advanced Server (up to and including version 14)
* EDB Postgres Extended (up to and including version 14)
* PostgreSQL (up to and including version 14)


Upon selecting the version of the Postgres server you want, two steps will be displayed.


### 1: Configuring repositories

For step 1, you can choose to use the automated script or step through the manual install instructions that are displayed. Your EDB repository token will be automatically inserted by the EDB Repos 2.0 site into these scripts. 
In our examples, it will be shown as `XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`.

On each provisioned host, either run the automatic repository installation script which will look like this: 

```shell
curl -1sLf 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/enterprise/setup.rpm.sh' | sudo -E bash
```

Or use the manual installation steps which look like this:

```shell
dnf install yum-utils 
rpm --import 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/enterprise/gpg.E71EB0829F1EF813.key'
curl -1sLf 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/enterprise/config.rpm.txt?distro=el&codename=9' > /tmp/enterprise.repo
dnf config-manager --add-repo '/tmp/enterprise.repo'
dnf -q makecache -y --disablerepo='*' --enablerepo='enterprisedb-enterprise'
```

### 2: Install Postgres

For step 2, we just run the command to install the packages.

```
sudo dnf -y install edb-as14-server
```
