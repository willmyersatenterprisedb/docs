EDB offers automated PGD deployment using TPA (Trusted Postgres Architect) because its generally more reliable than manual processes. 
Consult [Deploying with TPA](../../admin-tpa/installing.mdx) for how to install TPA and use its automated best-practice driven PGD deployment options for full details.

To complement automated installation, and to enable alternative installation and deployment processes, this section of the documentation looks at the basic operations needed to manually configure a three-node PGD 4 cluster (with a local sub-group) and PGD CLI.

This guide includes, for completeness, how to install PostgreSQL.

If you are familiar with that, then skip to step 3.

Each step will be outlined and followed by a worked example with further detail. 
This guide is not a quickstart guide, but an exploration of PGD installation, and it will configure a basic deployment which we will be using for further examples of PGD administration tasks.

In the examples, we will be deploying a 3-node cluster of EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9. These instructions should also apply to RHEL derivatives like Alma Linux, Rocky Linux, or Oracle Linux.


At the highest level, manually deploying PGD involves the following steps:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1: [Provisioning and configuring hosts](01-provisioning-hosts) to run the cluster on.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2: [Installing your selected Postgres version](02-install-postgres) on each of the hosts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3: [Configuring repositories to install PGD](03-configuring-repositories) to add PGD capabilities to each host.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4: [Initializing Postgres and installing PGD software](04-installing-software) on each host.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5: [Connecting the cluster](05-creating-cluster) by connecting to each node and telling it to join the cluster.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6: [Check the cluster](06-check-cluster) by running SQL commands and confirming replication has happened.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7: [Using PGD CLI](07-using-pgd-cli) covers installing PGD CLI and how to use it inspect and manage your cluster.
